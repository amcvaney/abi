// Abi

// I am currently a sophmore at Texas Tech University, majoring in Computer Science with minor in Cyber Security.
// I choose this path because of my fasination of Google and their work environment. I have grown up around people
// always said they wanted to be someone big, do something large. Never did they do anything. I do not want to go throughout // my life hating my work and feeling the boredom of going to work, but to have a colorful, inspiring, and creative place
// to share with co-workers that may feel the same.
